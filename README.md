# About Me 👋
I learned C++, Java, HTML and VB back in the late 90s (I forgot them all) and started a Python course in Udemy not long ago, boy how things have changed for the better now (as faster!)🤯! 

- 🌱 I am learning **Python**. I am a candidate in the [Techlabs's Digital Shaper Program](https://www.techlabs.org/) for Data Science track.  I want to like to learn Javascript, web/app development and Machine Learning. 
- 💪 My strengths: effective communicator, HR data analytics, change management. 
- 🤔 Tell me more: I’m looking for insights from others who can shared their brave journey to transition over to tech fields. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I crochet and likes to do art and craft. I can speak 7 languages (English, Mandarin, Cantonese, Hakka, Bahasa Malay, French and German).
